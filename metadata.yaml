description: One of the foremost fiction writers in the genre of Victorian realism,
  George Gissing wrote several of the most notable novels of the era, including New
  Grub Street and Born in Exile. The short novel Eve's Ransom is a classic story of
  misbegotten love wherein an impressionable young man falls for -- and attempts desperately
  to win over -- a woman who appears to be all wrong for him.
